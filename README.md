C - "Etch-a-Sketch and Pong"

# Purpose
  The purpose of this lab was to utilize some of the assembly code subroutines from Lab 3, along with C to create an etch-a-sketch program. 
  
  
# Prelab
  A handwritten copy of the prelab was turned into Capt Trimble on Monday 20 OCT 14.
  
# Required Functionality

  The required functionality wanted us to modify the subfunction drawBlock from Lab 3 to take in 3 values (x coord, y coord and color) instead of just 2 (x coord, y coord).
